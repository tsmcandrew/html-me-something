            <h3>My Story</h3>
            <br>
            <p>I was born April 30, 1985, in the West Texas town of El Paso. See you've got to define which part of Texas you're from.
              It's a gigantic state and as such has a very different demographic and feel from east-west, north-south.
              Though at times I find it intriguing to call myself a native Texan,
              in reality I only lived there for a very brief 6 months before my family relocated to
              Little Rock, Arkansas, the Diamond State.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We as a family would stay in Arkansas for a little over 3 years before my father landed a teaching and surgical position at
              Vanderbilt University Hospital in Nashville, TN. But before we move on, I guess I should mention about the only thing I really
              know exists in Little Rock, the William H. Clinton Presidential Library and Museum. It obviously wouldn't be built for many years
              after I had exited the picture in Little Rock, but sadly that's all I know about my former residence.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Which brings us up to speed and to Nashville, TN. Now, to date, my length-of-residence in Nashville is the longest time I've spent thus far in one location.
              I lived there from age 4-18, from when I was a little boy to when I was graduating High School and moving on to College.
              The Nashville I grew up in still had the old Tennessee feel you read about in the history books, but the rapid expansion of commerce
              and the diversifying of industries in the greater Middle Tennesee region was beginning to shape the cityscape and demographic of
              Nashville in a way that showed real progress and a shift towards modernity at the start of the 21st century.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Honestly, my time in TN will always be special to me. The uniqueness of it's outdoors, the people, the stories, the music and culture
              will forever remain a central part of who I am and what I know and love. From Nashville, I had a one year adventure at the
              University of Illinois - Urbana/Champaign where I studied Chemical Engineering, realized I didn't like IL or the strict curriculum of
              engineering, so I transfered to Clemson University and enrolled in the Architecture program, with an emphasis in Landscape Architecture.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The degree in Landscape Architecture was a 5 year, professional degree, of which I spent one semester studying abroad in Genoa, Italy.
              I can't begin to explain how valuable studying in Italy was to influencing my outlook on life, getting to know and embrace different
              cultures, and how profoundly it affected my aesthetic as a designer. Living withing a city with so many layers of history and modern design
              woven together in a contiguous and harmonious fabric is something you can only rarely find here in the United States. Couple that with living
              within a society that has been continuously evolving for 1000s of years and you really get some perspective on humanity.</p>
            <br>
            <p>After college, I moved to Chicago during the economic recession and did my best to find work in the design field. Without much luck, I was
              forced to look for any work and found myself writing as a music critic for an online publication. Through a mutual friend from Clemson via Houston, TX,
              I met a girl in Chicago and moved to New York City, NY, to pursue design and to be with her. Lauren was a trained Interior Designer who studied
              at the prestigious Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, NY, and so I found myself living in Brooklyn.</p>
            <br>
            <p>There are so many things I could talk about my time in NYC, but it would take too much time, so I'll place emphasis on the design and another
              passion of mine, the culinary arts. Foodies, chefs, mixologists, bakers, pastry artists, and the like swarm in masses to NYC to make their mark
              on the culinary world. NYC has the best of almost any type of cuisine you could imagine and because of that it's a real treat to experience both
              the food and the amazing people making it for you in the tight knit community that is the metropolis of NYC.</p>
            <br>
            <p>But after working a few jobs in Architecture up in Manhattan, I decided to the midwest and join the rest of my family. My oldest brother and his family
              moved to St. Louis, MO, around the same time I was heading off to Brooklyn, and so it was an easy move for me to St. Louis, and thus a new chapter in my life.
              Since moving here, I have worked a number of restaurant jobs, and currently am pursuing a new endeavor in computer science. If I had to lean towards a specialization,
              I would say that data analytics is the direction I'm leaning. With my multidiciplinary background and anaylitic mind, I feel that it would be both
              something I would be good at, but more importantly something I would very much enjoy.</p>
            <br>
            <p>So that's me in a nutshell. Feel free to check me out on github, twitter, or instagram! Cheers!
